Tree House, time to leaf and move on

## Description

This is an organizational app for people who need to find a new place to live. Once logged in, users can start a 'groove' of 'tree houses' which are listings for apartments and homes. The app will get their link from craigslist and create cards of all the listings they like. The cards provide basic information along with pictures to easily recongize listings they still want to consider without having to go to each site to view the page. 

There is a lot of WiP, such as, the ability to add users to the groove so everyone may add to the groove and like listings. 

This app uses the Model View Controller (MVC) architectural pattern that separates an application into three main logical components: the model, the view, and the controller.

## User Story

AS A user, I want to be organize multiple listings so I can view them all in one place.

I also WANT to scrape the data from websites by using links.

SO THAT I can create cards and view all listing in a easy way.
